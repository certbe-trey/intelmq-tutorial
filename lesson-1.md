# Lesson 1

Lesson 1 is the theoretical section where we explain all concepts and terms.

Currently this is only available as a [slide deck](images/slides.pptx)
If you are self-studying IntelMQ, please read the slide deck. If you are going through the lessons 
as part of the IntelMQ workshop, we will walk you through the slides and explain all the terms.
